A. Ncrack

Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.

Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting the user full control of network operations, allowing for very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap's and many more. Protocols supported include RDP, SSH, HTTP(S), SMB, POP3(S), VNC, FTP, SIP, Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Telnet.

StackEdit can be combined with <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** and <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** to have your documents saved in the *Cloud*. The synchronization mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.

> **Note:**

> - Full access to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Permission restrictions can be configured in the settings.
> - Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.
> - If you experience problems saving your documents on Google Drive, check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Open a document

You can open a document from <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** or the <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** by opening the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu and by clicking **Open from...**. Once opened, any modification in your document will be automatically synchronized with the file in your **Google Drive** / **Dropbox** account.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Save a document

You can save any document by opening the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu and by clicking **Save on...**. Even if your document is already synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**, you can export it to a another location. StackEdit can synchronize one document with multiple locations and accounts.
